      "correct": "The story is about two poor Armenian boys, Aram and his cousin Mourad, who belong to the Garoghlanian family, a tribe famous for its honesty and integrity. One early summer morning, Mourad wakes Aram and surprises him with a beautiful white horse. Aram is shocked because their family is extremely poor and could not afford a horse. Though he suspects the horse is stolen, he joins Mourad for a joyful ride.\n\nMourad, known as the \u201ccrazy\u201d member of the family, has a deep love for animals and believes he has a special understanding with them. The boys secretly hide the horse in a deserted barn and ride it every morning. Meanwhile, a farmer named John Byro, whose horse was stolen, visits Aram\u2019s house and sadly talks about his missing horse. This makes Aram uneasy.\n\nLater, when they meet John Byro, he recognizes the horse but trusts the family\u2019s reputation for honesty and does not accuse them. This deeply affects the boys. Feeling guilty and respecting their family values, they quietly return the horse. John Byro later finds his horse healthier and stronger, proving the boys had taken good care of it.\n\nThe story highlights honesty, innocence, childhood joy, and moral values.",
